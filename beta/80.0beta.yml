    **These notes apply to Thunderbird version 80 beta 5 released August 20, 2020.**

    OpenPGP in Thunderbird 80.0b1 has reached feature complete state, but it's still
    disabled by default, to allow more time for testing, correctness, and localization.
    See [the wiki](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Thunderbird:OpenPGP#Testing)
    for how to enable and help with testing.
