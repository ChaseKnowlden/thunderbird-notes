- note: '"Edit As New Message" will now use the account''s default compose format,
    either HTML or plain text ignoring the format of the message. Plain text messages
    will be converted to HTML and vice versa. Then using the modifier, the format
    choice will be reverted.'

    is necessary for "Edit As New Message" or when the shift modifier is used for
    "Edit Draft" or "New Message from Template".

  bug: 1387877
- note: In Thunderbird 54 beta a better support for Charter users was introduced.
    As a side effect, messages moved to a different IMAP folder were immediately removed
    from the source folder, even when the delete model "Just mark it as deleted" was
    in effect. This has now been restored to its pre-version 54 state, so moved IMAP
    messages are only crossed out in the source folder when this delete model is used.
  tag: changed
  bug: 1352859
- note: 'When many Thunderbird clients or other email clients accessed the same IMAP
    draft folder, messages were sometimes sent with the wrong identity. This has been
    corrected and the user will be notified if none of their identities matches the
    draft. '
  tag: fixed
