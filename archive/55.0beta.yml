notes:
  - note: |
      In general, date/time display will follow the application locale. That means that for example the English-US 
      version will display English-US date/time formats and the German version will display German date/time 
      formats. Date/time display **can be adjusted in the operating system settings** as long as the language used in by the
      OS matches the language of the application. For example an English-US version will respect settings for any English locale,
      like English-United Kingdom, English-Australia or English-India. A French version will respect settings for any French locale,
      like France or Canada.

      Further improvements are scheduled for version 56 beta.
